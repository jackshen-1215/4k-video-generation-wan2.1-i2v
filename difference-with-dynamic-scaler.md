**Summary:**  
**The implementation you describe in `image2video.py` is more explicit and fine-grained than the approach in the DynamicScaler repo.**

---

### **How the referenced implementation works:**
- It constructs explicit, fine-grained masks and indices that define, for each tile:
  - Which query positions are "foreground" (q_tile_spatial_fg_mask).
  - Which text tokens are foreground/background (k_text_fg_indices / k_text_bg_indices).
  - It threads these tile-specific, token-specific controls all the way into the attention function.
  - The attention module then builds a `(B, N_heads, S_q, S_k)` mask for `scaled_dot_product_attention`, so only certain query positions in the tile can attend to certain semantic tokens—**per tile, per call.**
  - This enables complex, region-aware, token-aware attention, controlled by the caller.

---

### **DynamicScaler repo approach:**
- **No explicit mask or indices are passed down from the pipeline.**
- The attention module (`lvdm/modules/attention_freetraj.py`) internally computes region masks based on the geometry of the tile/window and the model's knowledge of spatial layout.
- The mask is generated from spatial indices, not from a mask or set of indices passed in by the pipeline.
- All query positions in a tile are treated similarly; there isn’t a notion of "foreground" vs "background" query patches, nor explicit k_text_fg/bg indices.
- The logic is less fine-grained and less flexible: the region-to-token mapping is “hard-coded” by spatial math, not controlled by the pipeline.

---

### **Key differences:**
- **Explicitness/Flexibility:**  
  - The referenced implementation allows external control and per-tile, per-token flexibility, enabling nuanced relationships (e.g., only the center of the tile attends to subject tokens).
  - DynamicScaler relies on internal, spatially-determined masks, with no external control or per-tile semantic token selection.

- **Foreground/Background Handling:**  
  - The referenced implementation can distinguish between “foreground” and “background” query patches and semantic tokens, and mask attention accordingly.
  - DynamicScaler does not do this; all query positions in a tile/window attend according to the same (spatially-determined) mask.

- **Threading of mask/indices:**  
  - Referenced implementation: mask/indices are computed in the pipeline and passed down through the model to the attention function.
  - DynamicScaler: mask is computed only in the attention module, using only local information.

---

### **Conclusion:**
**No, the referenced implementation is not the same as (or even close to) DynamicScaler’s design.**  
- The referenced design is more explicit, flexible, and allows for per-tile, per-token attention control from the top-level pipeline.
- DynamicScaler’s design is simpler and less flexible, with masking hardcoded inside the attention module, and no pipeline-level control.
